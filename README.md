# org.timmc/handy

Just some handy utilities. The API is any var with :added metadata,
indicating the version of handy in which the var was introduced.
Generally, this covers any public var not marked :internal.

## Usage

If you use Leiningen, add the following to your project.clj dependencies:

`[org.timmc/handy "1.6.0"]`

The main namespace is `org.timmc.handy`.

Compatible with Clojure 1.2.0 through 1.6.0.

## Building

Built with Leiningen 2, but should be buildable with 1.x as well.

Test against all supported Clojure versions with `lein all-clj test`.
